    review: "I had almost given up hope that I would ever return to pre-pregnancy body... luckily I did not give up. Gibson helped me get back to my pre-pregnancy weight and put on more strength and muscle than I ever had. I feel great and have so much energy to spend with my 2 little ones. Gibson made exercise fun and enjoyable, which really helped me stay consistent."
